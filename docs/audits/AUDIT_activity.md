# Feature Audit — Settings ▸ Activity

**Feature slug:** `activity` · **Mode:** AUDIT+FIX · **Date:** 2026-07-10
**Branch:** `claude/activity-feature-audit-djfuym`
**Reviewer:** autonomous QA + fix session

---

## 1. Scope contract

**Definition.** The Settings ▸ "Activity" card (`/settings/activity`) is the
per-organisation run log. Its tile promises: *"Every run for this organisation
— status, matches, and one-click delete."* It is rendered by
`_render_settings_activity_section(prof)` in `src/mediahub/web/web.py`, and is a
**distinct surface** from the standalone `/activity` page (`activity_page`) and
the `/activity/feed` stream — those are out of scope except where behaviour must
stay consistent. "Working" means: for the pinned org (and only that org), it
lists recent runs with an honest status, the real engine output per run, and a
per-row delete that actually deletes and stays on the page; it degrades cleanly
with no org, no runs, or a store failure; and no user-controlled text can break
out into the page.

**Routes/endpoints owned or exercised.**
| Method | Path | Role |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/settings/activity` | The feature page (via `settings_section("activity")` → `_render_settings_activity_section`) |
| POST | `/privacy/run/<run_id>/delete` | Per-row delete (shared with Privacy / standalone Activity; **not owned**) |

**Files owned (blast radius).**
- `src/mediahub/web/web.py` — `_render_settings_activity_section` (the section
  renderer) and the "Activity" tile spec in `_settings_card_specs`.

**Shared files depended on but NOT freely rewritten.**
- `web.py`: `privacy_delete_run`, `_delete_run`, `_run_owner_profile_id`,
  `_warm_run_achievements`, `_RUN_DELETE_JS`, the CSRF `before_request`, the
  org-setup gate, the `runs` table schema, `settings_section` dispatch.

**Inputs / outputs / state.** Input: the session's pinned `active_profile_id`
(no caller-supplied id → no read-side IDOR). Output: an HTML table of the org's
runs. State: read from the `runs` table in `DATA_DIR/data.db`, scoped by
`profile_id`; delete cascades run JSON + sidecars + DB row + caches via
`_delete_run`.

**Intended happy path (concrete).** Pin an org → open Settings ▸ Activity → see
each recent run as a row: Input (meet/file name, links to `/review/<id>`),
Status badge (done/queued/running/error), Matched (`our_swims`), **Achievements**
(the real V5 recognition count), Started (relative time). Errored runs show a
"Why did this run fail?" expander and a top "N runs failed" callout. Each row
has a Delete button that removes the run in place (optimistic + 8s undo) and
stays on the page.

---

## 2. Environment

- **Run locally:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` (+ `--ignore-installed
  PyYAML` for the debian-managed copy), `pip install -e . --no-deps`, `pip
  install pytest ruff`. Booted with `PORT=5001 python -m mediahub.web`.
- **Port:** `http://localhost:5001`. Startup clean apart from the expected
  `env_check: No LLM provider configured` warning (AI honest-errors offline).
- **Offline / no-spend:** `.env` created from `.env.example` with a random
  `SECRET_KEY`, `DATA_DIR` under the session scratchpad, and **no provider
  keys** (Gemini/Anthropic unset). The Activity feature makes no AI/paid calls,
  so no provider stubbing was required; `.env` is gitignored and never staged.
- **Browser:** Python Playwright against the prebaked Chromium at
  `/opt/pw-browsers` (the Playwright MCP defaulted to a missing `chrome`
  channel, so the direct driver was used). Desktop 1280px + mobile 390px.
- **Fixtures / stubs:** two seeded orgs (`club-a`, `club-b`) and runs covering
  done / error / queued, a modern **V5 run** (`our_swims=30`, `n_achievements=7`,
  legacy `n_cards`/`n_queue=0`), an XSS meet name, and unicode/emoji. Matching
  run JSON files written so `_prune_orphaned_runs()` (import-time cleanup of
  done rows whose JSON is gone) doesn't eat the seed.

## 3. Test matrix results

| # | Dimension | Result | Note / evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Functional correctness | **FAIL → fixed** | Modern V5 runs showed "Queue / Total: 0 / 0", hiding the real `n_achievements`. Now an "Achievements" column (F-1). |
| 2 | Every interactive control | **PASS** | Delete (JSON `{ok:true}`), Input→`/review/<id>` (200 own / 404 cross-tenant), "Why did this run fail?" expander all correct. No dead/misrouted controls. |
| 3 | Input validation & edge cases | **PASS (w/ fixes)** | Empty org, no-runs, unicode/emoji, XSS name, error-without-text, >100 runs all handled; see F-2/F-4. |
| 4 | UI state handling | **PASS (w/ fix)** | loading (optimistic delete + undo), empty, error, success all render. Store-failure state fixed (F-5). |
| 5 | Server-side error handling | **PASS** | No 500s; bad run-id → 400, missing → 404, cross-tenant → 404, no CSRF → 403. No stack traces/paths leaked. |
| 6 | Data integrity | **PASS** | Counts read back correctly; tenant isolation holds on read and delete; delete cascades; re-render after delete is consistent. |
| 7 | Security | **PASS** | No read IDOR (active-profile only); delete guarded by `_run_owner_profile_id` cross-tenant check + run-id shape allowlist; CSRF enforced; meet name HTML-escaped via `_h()`; no secrets in output. Does not touch the passwordless `/developer` route. |
| 8 | Performance | **PASS** | Single `LIMIT 100` query + a bounded, self-healing achievements warm-up (JSON read once per row missing the column, then backfilled). No N+1 in steady state. |
| 9 | Responsive / a11y | **PASS (w/ fix)** | `mh-table-stack` collapses cleanly at 390px. Delete buttons given descriptive `aria-label`s (F-3). Residual: no `<table caption>` (low). |
| 10 | Rendered-graphic correctness | **N/A** | This feature renders no cards/PNGs. |
| 11 | Consistency & copy | **PASS (w/ fix)** | British English; no placeholder/debug/TODO. New copy uses plain hyphens. colspan mismatch fixed (F-6). |

## 4. Findings

| ID | Sev | Title | Reproduction | Root cause | Status | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F-1 | **P1** | Activity shows legacy "Queue / Total" (0/0 for modern runs), hiding the real engine output | Seed a V5 run (`our_swims=30`, `n_achievements=7`, `n_cards=n_queue=0`); open `/settings/activity` → row reads **Queue / Total: 0 / 0**. | The renderer printed `n_queue / n_cards`, which the V5 recognition-first pipeline leaves at 0. The standalone `/activity` page was fixed (a "Council STEP 3" pass) to surface `n_achievements`; the Settings mirror was never updated. A successful run reads as "produced nothing". | **Fixed** | `08a65c0` |
| F-2 | P2 | "Every run" tile vs silent 100-run truncation | Seed 105 runs; only 100 shown, no notice. | `LIMIT 100` with no disclosure; tile copy promises "every run". | **Fixed** — honest "Showing the 100 most recent of N" note when older runs exist. | `08a65c0` |
| F-3 | P2 | Delete buttons indistinguishable to screen readers | Playwright a11y snapshot: 5 buttons, all accessible-named just "Delete". | No per-row `aria-label`. | **Fixed** — `aria-label="Delete <meet name>"`. | `08a65c0` |
| F-4 | P3 | Failure callout undercounts vs the red "error" badge | Seed two error runs, one with empty `error` text → callout said "1 run failed" while two rows show an error badge. | `n_errored` was incremented only inside `if status=="error" and error`. | **Fixed** — count on status alone; expander stays gated on captured text (never invent a reason). | `08a65c0` |
| F-5 | P3 | Store-read failure masquerades as an empty org | Monkeypatch `_db` to raise → page shows "No results yet for this organisation". | `except Exception: rows = []` conflated a DB failure with a genuinely empty org. | **Fixed** — distinct honest "couldn't reach the runs store" card. | `08a65c0` |
| F-6 | P3 | Error-detail row `colspan="7"` in a 6-column table | Inspect the error row markup. | Copy inherited a 7-column colspan; the table has 6 columns. | **Fixed** — `colspan="6"`. | `08a65c0` |
| F-7 | P3 | Input cell (meet/file name) has no length clamp | A very long unbroken meet name could stretch the row (error text is clamped to 600 chars; the Input cell is not). | Same pattern as the standalone `/activity` page; CSS `mh-table-stack` word-wraps in practice. | **Logged** (not fixed) — see §8; deliberately not diverged from the standalone page. | — |

No P0 found. The feature does not touch the known passwordless `/developer`
concern.

## 5. Fixes applied

All fixes are confined to `_render_settings_activity_section` in
`src/mediahub/web/web.py` (one function; **no shared file rewritten**):

1. **Achievements column (F-1).** Added `n_achievements` to the `SELECT` and
   call the existing `_warm_run_achievements(conn, rows)` helper (the same one
   the standalone page uses) before closing the connection; the "Queue / Total"
   column and header became "Achievements" fed by `ach_by_id`.
2. **Honest 100-run cap (F-2).** Added a bounded `SELECT COUNT(*)` and, when it
   exceeds the shown rows, a small "Showing the 100 most recent runs of N total"
   note under the table.
3. **Accessible delete (F-3).** Added `aria-label="Delete <label>"` to each
   per-row Delete button (label = meet/file name/id).
4. **Failure count (F-4).** `n_errored` now counts every `status=="error"` row;
   the "Why did this run fail?" expander stays gated on captured error text.
5. **Honest store-failure state (F-5).** A `db_failed` flag returns a distinct
   error card instead of the empty-state copy.
6. **colspan (F-6).** Error-detail row `colspan` corrected from 7 to 6.

---

## 6. Tests added

`tests/test_settings_activity_section.py` (new, 12 tests, all pass), following
the `tests/test_activity_scoping.py` fixture pattern:

- `TestAchievementsColumn` — locks the Achievements column shows `n_achievements`
  (not 0/0) and "Queue / Total" is gone; Matched still shows `our_swims`.
- `TestTenantIsolation` — pinned org sees only its own runs; empty-state for a
  no-runs org.
- `TestXssEscaping` — `<script>` in a meet name is HTML-escaped.
- `TestDeleteAffordance` — descriptive `aria-label`; delete form targets the
  privacy delete route with `next=/settings/activity`.
- `TestFailureCallout` — an error run with no error text is still counted;
  singular/plural wording.
- `TestTruncationNotice` — no note under 100 runs; honest note at 105.
- `TestDbFailure` — a runs-store read failure shows the honest error, not the
  empty state.

---

## 7. Cross-cutting changes

**None.** No shared file was rewritten. The fix reuses the existing shared
`_warm_run_achievements` helper (unchanged) and the shared `privacy_delete_run`
route (unchanged). The only edited production file is `web.py`, and only inside
the single feature-owned function — the smallest possible footprint for parallel
reconciliation.

---

## 8. Residual risks / cross-feature notes

- **F-7 (logged):** the Input cell isn't length-clamped. Left as-is to stay
  identical to the standalone `/activity` page; a fix should be applied to both
  surfaces together, not just here.
- **No `<table caption>`** for the runs table (the section intro supplies visual
  context but isn't programmatically associated). Low-priority a11y polish,
  shared with the standalone page.
- **Import-time `_prune_orphaned_runs()`** deletes `done` rows whose run JSON is
  missing. Correct sandbox behaviour, but it means seeded DB rows without JSON
  vanish on restart — a testing gotcha, not a feature bug. Out of scope.
- **Auth model:** any session that can pin an org sees that org's Activity. This
  is the app-wide profile/anti-enumeration model (ADR-0014), not specific to
  this feature — no change made.

---

## 9. Feature verdict

**WORKS-WITH-CAVEATS → WORKS (after fix).** The one material defect (F-1: every
modern run reading as "0 / 0 produced nothing") is fixed and test-locked, along
with five smaller correctness/honesty/a11y issues. One cosmetic residual (F-7)
is logged for a cross-surface fix. Security, tenant isolation, and error
handling were already sound.

## 10. Handover & merge status

- **Branch:** `claude/activity-feature-audit-djfuym` (the session's designated
  development branch, per the environment's Git requirements; all work and the
  final push go here).
- **Merge status:** see the PR opened for this branch against `main`. Per the
  environment's Git rules this session pushes to its designated branch and opens
  a **draft PR** rather than pushing directly to `main`; CI is the green gate for
  any merge. Green gate run locally before push: app boots clean; the new module
  (12) + the related regression subset (activity / privacy / run / settings —
  144 tests) pass; `ruff check` clean on both changed files; no secrets/`.env`
  staged.
- **Review the diff:** `git diff origin/main...claude/activity-feature-audit-djfuym`
